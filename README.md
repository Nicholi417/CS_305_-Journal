# CS_305_-Journal
This is the journal entry for the SNHU class CS 305. The journal will have a readme file answering questions required and a copy of the project used.



1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client for this project was a financial institution called Artemis Financial. They are a gloabal banking company that uses online resources to let customers and clients manage there money. In this section of the project they wanted a recommendation and emplementation of a security framework on an existing set of code.


2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I am personally very critical of my work and don't think I did very on anything, however, due to feedback on the project itself my emplementation was above average. Making sure that code is secure is very important since this is a financial company handling the money of others. Poor money handling has lead to depression and deaths. Also the wellbeing of the company and its shareholders can be greatly effected if they loose credibility from security breaches.


3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Getting the code to behave correctly when it wasn't me who started the code. It is like making a cake from scratch when someone else quit half way through the process. You have half the batter made but you don't know how precise they were.


4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I added AES because is a common highly rated standard and chose the highest form of it. This was due to it being the most secure for people's money. In the future it may be interesting to work with some other types of security but this was good for now.


5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I put the security into its own class so that only the things I wanted would call upon it to secure. This would limit the amount of things interacting with my code and potentially opening up conflicts and errors.


6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I like splitting things into classes. It helps makes the code more managable. I also used IntelliJ over the recommended Eclipse. This was due to IntelliJ being a lot smarter with figuring out this was a Maven project and knowing how to sort the project files themselves.

  
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them the breaking down of the classes created and the calling of each class in specific areas of code.
